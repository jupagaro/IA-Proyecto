Con esto, se logró una puntuación mínima de nuestros datos de prueba de 0,79, pero es posible una mejora de este resultado, como se dijo antes. A medida que se puedan agregar más capas ocultas, aumente la cantidad de neuronas y cambie las funciones de activación de la misma manera. Todo esto nos da más grados de libertad para mejorar nuestra red neuronal artificial.\n",

        "Los resultados de los distintos métodos, al aplicar PCA mejoraron considerablemente, aún cuando no reduje la dimensionalidad del problema, esto también fue porque a mi criterio no hubo ningina dimensión que explicara considarablemente menos porcentaje de la varianza respecto a otras dimensiones. De esto concluimos que las características presentes en el conjunto de datos tienen una influencia significativa en la salida de nuestros algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado implementados, esto puede deberse a que las características no son combinaciones lineales entre ellas."
